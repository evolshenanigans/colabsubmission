              In my journey as a software developer, I have always been captivated
              by the frontier technologies that have the potential to redefine our
              digital lives. One such technology that has caught my fascination is
              Web3. The promise of a decentralized internet, where users have true
              ownership of their data, is profoundly transformative. This curiosity
              led me to delve into Web3 technologies, becoming proficient in
              languages and frameworks that are the backbone of decentralized
              applications. As an extension of this interest, I decided to develop a
              crypto tracker, an application that is inextricably linked with
              blockchain technology. Building this tracker was not just a coding
              exercise for me; it was an opportunity to deepen my understanding of
              how Web3 technologies can be applied in real-world use-cases. With a
              front-end built in React and Next.js, and a back-end orchestrated with
              Node.js and GoLang, the crypto tracker serves as a comprehensive
              showcase of my full-stack development capabilities. More importantly,
              it stands as a testament to my commitment to mastering emerging
              technologies and applying them in ways that make complex systems more
              accessible and understandable to the everyday user. I invite you to
              explore this project and others in my portfolio to get a sense of how
              I am leveraging Web3 to build the future of the internet.
